# VoIP_SIP
Implementation of VOICE OVER IP (VoIP) using SIP Connections              
In this project, the primary objective is to set up calls between clients via a server using SIP protocol.
Users use Asterisk Software for making calls to each other. 
Once the connection is established, various call scenarios are being tested thereafter.
